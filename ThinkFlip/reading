Here's a structured approach to building your flashcard generator app in SwiftUI using MVVM:


---

1. Project Setup

Create a new SwiftUI project with MVVM architecture.

Define the core features: scanning, AI summarization, and flashcard generation.



---

2. Core Components

a) Scanning Module

Use VisionKit (VNDocumentCameraViewController) to scan pages.

Convert scanned images into text using Vision (VNRecognizeTextRequest).

Store extracted text for processing.


b) AI Summarization

Send the extracted text to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI API).

Process the response into structured topics and descriptions.

Store the summarized data.


c) Flashcard Generation

Convert AI-generated summaries into flashcards.

Use a data model to represent flashcards.

Store flashcards persistently using Core Data, UserDefaults, or CloudKit.



---

3. MVVM Architecture

Model

ScannedTextModel: Stores raw text from scanned pages.

FlashcardModel: Stores flashcard topic and description.


ViewModel

ScannerViewModel: Handles scanning logic and text extraction.

AIProcessingViewModel: Sends text to AI and receives structured data.

FlashcardViewModel: Manages flashcard creation and storage.


View

ScannerView: Displays camera interface for scanning.

ProcessingView: Shows AI processing status.

FlashcardView: Displays the generated flashcards.



---

4. Workflow

1. User scans pages → ScannerViewModel extracts text.


2. User submits text → AIProcessingViewModel sends text to AI.


3. AI returns structured topics & descriptions → FlashcardViewModel stores flashcards.


4. User reviews flashcards in FlashcardView.




---

5. Enhancements

Add animations for better UX.

Allow editing of flashcards.

Support iCloud sync for multiple devices.
